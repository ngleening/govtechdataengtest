# Section 1 Components

## Files included:

	1. documentation
	2. process_dataset.ipynb - python codes to process dataset with description and formatting
	3. process_dataset.py - python codes to process dataset (used for scheduling)
	4. new_dataset - new dataset that is an output from the processing
	5. cron commands - contains the cron commands for scheduling

## Tasks breakdown:

	1. Processing
	- File name: dataset_schedule.py
	- Output: new_dataset.csv
	- Tools used: Jupyter, Visual Studio Code, Python (Libraries: Pandas, Numpy)
	- Reason: Widely used, functions within library are useful
	- Alternatives: Coding in other languages that can handle CSV files such as R

	2. Scheduling
	- Tools used: Ubuntu (cron)
	- Reason: Simple
	- Improvements: Use command "whereis python3" and insert directory instead
	- Alternatives: Task Scheduler (Window's in-built app)
